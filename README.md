# Daily-C
Hi,
I am Rahul Gaikwad. I am an engineering student from India. 

I learn C language in my school. Then I decided to make C programming as hobby. I started solving daily problems with C for the practising.
So I share my codes with all for purposefully. I hope this helps to the new enthusiastics who wants to learn C.


Cheers !!
